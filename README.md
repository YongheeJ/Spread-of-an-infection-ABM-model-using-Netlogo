# Spread-of-an-infection-ABM-model-using-Netlogo

This is an agent-based model (ABM) of a complex observed phenomenon using NetLogo
In this model, I will show the sprea of an infection (such as COVID-19) through a population within specific area.
Also, there is a description of the model using the ODD protocol (Overview, Design concepts, Details).
